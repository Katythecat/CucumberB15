LoginPage -
DashboardPage -

Page object model - to have organised code and easy to maintain structure
        according to it, we create separate class (page) according to the
        screens available in the application and keep all the locators of this page
        in it

Parameterization testing
    -- we can one add employee using feature file - 'instead of passing hardcoded data,
    we pass values inside the scenario such as "abc" , "xyz" etc'

    -- to increase the scope of testing, we use data driven testing concept
    instead of scenario, we use scenario outline with examples table
    -- in examples table, we pass multiple data sets using keys and values


Data table -
     it allows us to pass multiple sets of data without executing background

Outline - Examples table - hooks and background execute every time as per the data set
Scenario - Data table - hooks and background execute just one time
