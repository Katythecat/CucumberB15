POM - page object model - An object Repository [It stores or holds all the
WebElements specific to a particular page]

it allows QA's to keep object repository -
in simple language, QA's write all the locators of the page in respective class

LoginPage -
DashboardPage -

Page object model - to have organised code and easy to maintain structure
        according to it, we create separate class (page) according to the
        screens available in the application and keep all the locators of this page
        in it

Parameterization testing
    -- we can one add employee using feature file - 'instead of passing hardcoded data,
    we pass values inside the scenario such as "abc" , "xyz" etc'

    -- to increase the scope of testing, we use data driven testing concept
    instead of scenario, we use scenario outline with examples table
    -- in examples table, we pass multiple data sets using keys and values


Data table -
     it allows us to pass multiple sets of data without executing background

Outline - Examples table - hooks and background execute every time as per the data set
Scenario - Data table - hooks and background execute just one time

Working with excel
.xls - HSSF
.xlsx - XSSF

Scenario Outline VS Data Table
Scenario Outline if even one test case fail it will keep running to check all
but for data table it will stop and won't execute the rest

Scenario better to use for check the set of data like login page with multiple username and pass word
Data Table good for check in step like this

a Data Table is a way of presenting data in a table format within
a Scenario or Scenario Outline. It is used to provide input data to a step,
or to verify the output of a step. For example,
you might have a scenario where you want to test the addition functionality
of a calculator. You could use a Data Table to provide multiple input
data sets and expected output values to the "addition" step.

Scenario: Verify addition function of calculator
   Given I have a calculator
   When I enter the following numbers for addition:
     | Number 1 | Number 2 |
     | 2        | 3        |
     | 5        | 7        |
     | 10       | 15       |
   Then the calculator should return the following results:
     | Result  |
     | 5       |
     | 12      |
     | 25      |
