Plugin :

The Maven Surefire Plugin
is used to execute tests in a Maven project
including JUnit and TestNG tests. When you create a Test Runner class in a Cucumber project,
you are defining a way to run the Cucumber scenarios, but you still need a way
to execute the tests.

The Test Runner class in a Cucumber project is responsible for loading the feature files,
defining the glue code (step definitions), and running the tests.
However, it does not execute the tests directly.
Instead, the Test Runner class delegates the execution of each scenario
to the Cucumber engine.

The Maven Surefire Plugin provides a way to execute the Test Runner class
and run the Cucumber scenarios as part of the Maven build process.
By configuring the Surefire Plugin to include the Test Runner class,
you can ensure that the Cucumber scenarios are executed as part of the build process,
and that the build fails if any scenarios fail.

In summary, the Test Runner class defines how the Cucumber scenarios should be executed,
while the Maven Surefire Plugin provides a way to actually execute the tests
and integrate them into the Maven build process.

The "maven-cucumber-reporting" plugin:
This plugin is used to generate reports for Cucumber test results.

the maven-cucumber-reporting plugin is not used to generate the cucumber.json file.
The cucumber.json file is generated by the Cucumber framework itself,
which writes the test results in JSON format.

The maven-cucumber-reporting plugin is used to generate a human-readable HTML report
from the JSON output file produced by Cucumber.
The plugin reads the JSON files generated by Cucumber and uses the information
to create an interactive report that provides details about the executed scenarios,
steps, and their status.

The maven-cucumber-reporting plugin is configured in the pom.xml file
of the Maven project and requires the JSON files generated by Cucumber as input.
It provides a set of customizable templates to generate an HTML report that
can be opened in any web browser.

So, while the maven-cucumber-reporting plugin does not directly generate
the cucumber.json file, it is an essential tool for converting the JSON output
into a human-readable report.

cucumber.json
the JSON format is designed to be machine-readable, rather than human-readable.

The JSON output is typically used as input to other tools or systems
that can interpret the JSON data and generate more user-friendly reports
or visualizations. For example, you can use a tool like Cucumber Report
or Cucumber-JVM Report to convert the JSON output into an HTML report
with more detailed information about the test results,
such as the number of scenarios that passed or failed, the duration of each scenario,
and any associated screenshots or log files.
